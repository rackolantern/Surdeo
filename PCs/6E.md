**Android Rogue - Psyknife**
A military android who broke free of their innate programming to search for freedom

- Has 15 other "siblings"
- A bluebell symbol on a pin is one of his more important things, but he's not completely sure what it means
- Can deceive to an astounding degree: mimicked [[Ley]] to approach [[Veylin]] when we went through the [[Veilwood Glade]]
- Learned how to make sourdough bread from [[Rev]] for [[Crane]]... Crane doesn't deserve such a fucking bestie for fucking real though
