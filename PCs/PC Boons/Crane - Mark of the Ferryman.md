Divine Touch: Xereth
[[Crane]]

**Mark of the Ferryman** 
When an ally within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points but isnâ€™t outright killed, you can stabilize them as a reaction. The ally also gains temporary hit points equal to your level. You take damage per round of combat equal to the number of times you have used this ability per long rest, until any allies are up to their full HP again. Once combat ends, this damage will continue to be taken every 2 seconds, until you are KO'd, unless your allies are fully healed.
