Instead of killing them when they refused to act on orders, they were left in [[Marrowflight]]’s town square. That’s a little sanctuary where wizards stopped at during a pilgrimage.”

_She sighs and swirls her drink._ “Anyway, we took them in. They promised to give us intel about somethin’ we’re looking at in exchange for protection. I call ‘em “[[Silver]]” because they’ve got these streaks of silver on their skin.. I know, I know. Original.” 

“Problem is… just after [[Rev]] here contacted me, Silver was stolen back. Middle of the night, just _poof_. We were given instructions. Even if we weren’t given instructions, my people are depleted. We suffered a lot of injuries getting to the village.[[ EX-90]], they… planted these gas bombs. Traps. There were a few casualties. I need you, V. Silver’s got a lot more to give, I just know it. They have a lot of information.” She shifts uncomfortably. 

“I didn’t know we’d have company, but I guess it’s for the best. They want your friend here.” 

She looks at [[Evangeline]]. “In exchange for the prisoner.”
